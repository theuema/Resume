## Resume Template
This is an easy and modern resume template. <br />
Build with XeLaTeX. <br />

* It uses code, ideas, and fonts from https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume. <br />
* I did change a few layout things to fit my needs, added various commands and made it multi page.<br /><br />
* The resume example actually uses a fictional character from the tv series "The IT Crowd", which i really recommend watching.
