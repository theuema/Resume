	\section{Recent Experience} 
	
		\sheader{2020: Neural Networks}
		This lecture discussed Feed-forward, Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks, weight-space symmetries, network training, error backpropagation, various training algorithms and regularization in Neural Networks. We most commonly used Tensorflow and Keras for our assignments. \sectionsep

		\sheader{2020 Security Aspects in Software Development}
		In this elective course i had the opportunity for new insights about the ability to recognize and classify bugs, (efficiently) find bugs, exploit bugs, fix bugs, and prevent bugs in the first place. We studied and exploited various memory corruption vulnerabilities including countermeasures, learned how to use different analysis, sanitizers or fuzzing to find bugs and how to prevent these performing defensive programming in C and C++. \sectionsep		
	
		\sheader{2019: IT Security}
		The main focus of \textit{IT Security} was to implement the TLS protocol with a pre-shared key handshake and Ascon and AES-GCM as authenticated encryption schemes with all its primitives, where we learned the importance of random number generators when generating a cryptographic key as well as basic key management techniques. Additionally, we implemented our own blockchain based secure crypto currency. \sectionsep
	
		\sheader{2019: Machine Learning}
		We learned about the basic theory of inference and decision, information theory, probability and distributions. We acquired understanding in the field of convex optimization problems, linear models for regression and classification as well as Kernel Methods up to our last assignment that required to implement a Support Vector Machine. \sectionsep
	
		\sheader{2018: Principles of Brain Computation}
		Course contents can be summarized in: Levels of organization in the brain, neurons in biological systems and computation neuroscience. In fact, we used a simulator for spiking neural network models called \textit{NEST}, that focuses on the dynamics, size and structure of neural systems. Principles of plasticity and learning, using different synapse and neural models to develop a recurrent spiking neural network happen to be the main course essentials. \sectionsep
	
		\sheader{2018: Verification \& Testing}
		In this course we used \textit{Static Analysis} and \textit{Hoare Logic} to find possible bugs in a specific source code. We also had to automate identification of deadlocks running two threads continuously. Heard about BFS \& DFS in context of the \textit{Java Path Finder}.  \sectionsep
	
		\sheader{2017 / 2018: BSc Thesis}
		My thesis and practical work is about simulating a modern last level CPU-cache behaviour using QEMU. It will be possible to customize the cache in terms of cache line replacement policy, cache size and timing. The goal is to quickly and efficiently simulate side channel attacks on emulated hardware. \sectionsep
	
		\sheader{2017: Introduction to Information Security}
		By taking this course I completed a challenge called \textit{C Security Challenge}. The goal was to exploit pre-written code (C \& C++) changing its behavior to get a flag placed in an area that should be protected from not permitted access (CTF). \sectionsep
		
		\sheader{2017: Distributed Systems}
		Implemented a distributed system that uses message channels and message queues to perform distributed calculations. Therefore, gained experience in client/server logic, websocket technology and javascript. \sectionsep
		
		\sheader{2016: Operating Systems}
		A group-project to realize a small operating system called \textit{SWEB}. \\ 
		Main parts: Use and implement functions nearly similar to POSIX standard; Implement multi-threading compatibility; Implement memory management;\sectionsep
